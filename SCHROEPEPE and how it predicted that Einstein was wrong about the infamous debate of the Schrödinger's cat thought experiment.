On April 2017 Netidx dropped a rare Pepe called SCHROEPEPE Series 22 - Card 4. The Artist coded the token in a way that depending on where you look at it, you could either see a dead cat or an alive cat.  Not only is that historical in it self because this is the first Rare Pepe card to do something like this. The card was created to show Schrodinger's cat thought experiment. In quantum mechanics, Schrödinger's thought experiment illustrates a paradox of quantum superposition. In the thought experiment, a hypothetical cat may be considered simultaneously both alive and dead, while it is unobserved in a closed box, as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. This thought experiment was devised by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 in a discussion with Albert Einstein to illustrate what Schrödinger saw as the problems of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. In English? Pretty much the thought experiment says that everything exists in more than one state all the time. Depending on what space and time you look at it is and only is when you can see what state it is in. It was an infamous debate between Eintein and Schrodinger. But no body could prove who was corect back then because there was no way to measure atoms. Until 2022 when 3 physicists won the Nobel prize in physics proving that Einstein was wrong and Schrodinger was correct by, simply put; proving the bells theorem to be true. (link to the quantum physics explanation; https://www.quantamagazine.org/pioneering-quantum-physicists-win-nobel-prize-in-physics-20221004/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw3a2iBhCFARIsAD4jQB2aGGqRefgivDnma-SNAXSLszuxPp8qQoCGNINv8DYXdqvz-FBWKcYaAlrQEALw_wcB)  So Netidx and the SCHROEPEPE card sided with Schrodinger and predicted that shrodinger was correct back in 2017 way before it was actually proven by three Physicists in 2022.  If he didn't then the artist wouldn't have shown the cat dead and alive depending on what screen you saw it on. He could have shown the cat dead in one and in another a cat dead as well with Einstein in it yelling "I was right" or something along those lines. And there it is boys and girls. Another magnificent lore from the Book of Kek. Rare Pepes have magical powers and can predict the future and bring you riches beyond your wildest dreams.
